# dotfiles

Here lies my dotfiles for [Linux](./linux) and [macOS](./macOS)

For the softwares that I use on both systems, the dotfiles are included in the [shared folder](./shared). I try to avoid as much as possible using conditional settings depending on the OS for those, but unfortunately, it's sometimes impossible to avoid (especially in fish's settings)

For more information on a specific configuration, see the README.md files at the root of each folder

## Collaboration

PRs of any kinds are welcome. However, I will be reticent to merge anything that would change my workflow substantially or the visuals (as those are mostly personal choices) but I'm always open to consider alternatives to my current tools or possible improvements!
