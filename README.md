## Configuration:

- Distribution: Ubuntu (at work), ArchLinux (at home)
- WM: [i3-gaps](https://github.com/polybar/polybar)
- Bar: [Polybar](https://github.com/polybar/polybar)
- Compositor: None (at work), Compton (at home)
- Terminal Emulator: [Alacritty](https://github.com/polybar/polybar)
- Shell: Fish

## Requirements:
- [polybar-spotify](https://github.com/Jvanrhijn/polybar-spotify) to show currently playing song in the bar, place in the same folder as polybar config file

Currently, no script to automatically install the dotfiles + dependencies exist
