### Old setup files

These config files are for softwares I don't use actively anymore (but could reuse in the future) and softwares I used before switching to Wayland

Those are mostly Linux things but certain softwares could be used on Windows/macOS so I don't split this folder

#### Linux stuff
`i3` became `sway`

`polybar` became `waybar`

`dunst` became `mako`
