# dotfiles

Here lies my dotfiles for my [linux desktop](./linux) and [macOS laptop](./macOS)

Some software I use on both my systems, those are included in the [shared folder](./shared). I usually try to avoid as much as possible using conditional settings depending on the OS for those, but unfortunately, it's sometimes impossible to avoid (especially in fish's settings)

For more information on a specific configuration, see the README.md files at the root of each folder

## Collaboration

PRs of any kinds are welcome. However, I will be reticent to merge anything that would change my workflow substantially or the visuals (as those are mostly personal choices) but I'm always open to consider alternatives to my current tools or possible improvements!

Additionally, you can most definitely copy / take inspiration from any files here unless mentioned otherwise

I learned how to customize my setup by looking at popular dotfiles, I'd be hypocrite to not allow for that to happen with mine
